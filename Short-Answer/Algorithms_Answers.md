#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) At the first look, there is one while loop. This while loop is based on the condition of n*n*n and
n\*n is getting added in the inside. However, the whole loop is based on the value of n. With one while loop
which is based on the value of n, the run time complexity will be O(n).

b)

c)
